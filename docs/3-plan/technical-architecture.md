# Technical Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the technical architecture for the project. It outlines the technology stack, system components, and data flow.

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
    - **Framework**: Next.js (React)
    - **UI Library**: Shadcn UI
    - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
    - **State Management**: React Context API / Zustand (to be decided based on complexity)
    - **Data Fetching**: SWR / React Query
- **Backend**:
    - **Framework**: Next.js API Routes / Standalone Node.js server (e.g., Express)
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (to be decided based on data model)
    - **Authentication**: NextAuth.js / Custom implementation with JWT
- **Deployment**:
    - **Platform**: Vercel / AWS / Netlify
    - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 2. System Architecture Diagram

[A diagram illustrating the system architecture can be embedded here. For now, a textual description will be used.]

The architecture will follow a client-server model:

- **Client (Browser)**: The Next.js application will be rendered in the user's browser. It will handle UI, client-side logic, and communication with the backend.
- **Web Server**: Vercel (or another platform) will host the Next.js application, handling server-side rendering (SSR) or serving static assets (SSG).
- **API Layer**: The backend API (built with Next.js API routes or a separate server) will handle business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
- **Database**: The database will store all application data.

## 3. Data Flow

1. A user interacts with the client application in their browser.
2. The client sends a request to the Next.js server.
3. For data-related requests, the Next.js server (or API layer) communicates with the database.
4. The database returns the requested data.
5. The API layer processes the data and sends a response to the client.
6. The client renders the data in the UI.

## 4. Key Architectural Decisions

- **Monorepo vs. Polyrepo**: We will start with a single repository (monorepo) for simplicity. If the project grows in complexity, we may consider splitting it into multiple repositories.
- **Serverless vs. Traditional Server**: We will leverage serverless functions (e.g., Next.js API routes on Vercel) for our backend to simplify deployment and scaling.
