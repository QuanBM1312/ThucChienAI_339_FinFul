# Testing Practices

A robust testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the quality, reliability, and maintainability of our application. This document outlines the testing practices and methodologies to be followed.

## 1. Testing Levels

We will adopt a multi-layered testing approach, focusing on the following levels:

### 1.1. Unit Testing
- **Objective**: To test individual components and functions in isolation.
- **Framework**: We will use Jest as the primary testing framework.
- **Library**: React Testing Library will be used for testing React components to ensure they are accessible and function correctly from a user's perspective.
- **Scope**: All critical business logic, helper functions, and individual UI components must have unit tests.
- **Coverage**: Aim for a high level of code coverage (e.g., >80%) for critical parts of the application.

### 1.2. Integration Testing
- **Objective**: To test the interaction between multiple components or services.
- **Tools**: We will use Jest and React Testing Library to test how components work together. For API interactions, we will use mock service workers (MSW) to simulate API responses.
- **Scope**: Test user flows that involve multiple components, such as form submissions, navigation, and data fetching.

### 1.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Objective**: To test the application flow from start to finish, simulating real user scenarios.
- **Framework**: We will use Cypress for E2E testing.
- **Scope**: Cover critical user paths, such as user registration, login, and core application features. E2E tests will be run in a CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions before deployment.

## 2. Test Writing Guidelines

- **Clarity**: Tests should be readable and easy to understand. Use descriptive names for test suites and individual tests.
- **AAA Pattern**: Structure tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
    - **Arrange**: Set up the test environment and input data.
    - **Act**: Execute the function or component being tested.
    - **Assert**: Verify that the outcome is as expected.
- **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests.

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI)

- All tests (unit, integration, and E2E) will be run automatically in our CI/CD pipeline for every pull request.
- A pull request cannot be merged if any tests are failing.
