# Performance Guidelines

Application performance is a critical aspect of user experience. This document outlines the guidelines and best practices to ensure our application is fast, responsive, and efficient.

## 1. Frontend Performance

### 1.1. Asset Optimization
- **Image Optimization**: Images should be compressed and served in modern formats (e.g., WebP). Use responsive images to serve appropriate sizes for different devices.
- **Code Splitting**: Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to ensure that only the necessary JavaScript is loaded for each page.
- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy load images, videos, and components that are not in the initial viewport.

### 1.2. Rendering Performance
- **Memoization**: Use `React.memo` for functional components and `useMemo`/`useCallback` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Utilize Next.js's rendering capabilities (SSR/SSG) to deliver fast initial page loads. Choose the appropriate rendering method for each page based on its data requirements.
- **Virtualization**: For long lists, use virtualization (windowing) to render only the visible items.

### 1.3. Network Performance
- **Minimize HTTP Requests**: Bundle assets and use sprites for icons where appropriate.
- **Caching**: Implement effective caching strategies for API responses and static assets.
- **CDN**: Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve assets closer to the user.

## 2. Backend Performance

### 2.1. API Design
- **Payload Size**: Keep API response payloads as small as possible. Use pagination for large datasets.
- **Query Optimization**: Ensure that database queries are efficient. Use indexing and avoid N+1 query problems.

### 2.2. Monitoring and Analysis
- **Tools**: We will use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and the browser's DevTools to analyze and monitor performance.
- **Performance Budget**: We will establish a performance budget (e.g., max bundle size, max load time) and monitor it continuously.

## 3. Performance Culture
- Performance is a shared responsibility. All developers should be mindful of performance implications when writing code.
- Regular performance reviews and optimizations should be part of the development cycle.
